# adapt-page2TextFile
================

An extension that allows you to save to a text file from the current page you are on. This extension can be used within Adapt Authoring Tool. Please note the button will not show in the drawer until "<strong>?export=on</strong>" is typed in front of the # in the URL path. This is so that users will not be able to see question feedback potentially giving them the answers in the course when the page is saved to a text file.<br><br>
